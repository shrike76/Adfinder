FIGURE THIS THING OUT

following this guide https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-beginners-guide-to-tesseract-ocr-using-pytesseract-23036f5b2211

downloaded tesseract v 5.0.1.20220118 from https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/?C=M;O=D
made python correctly add stuff to PATH
pip install pytesseract
WORKING POG

using this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-all-images-from-a-web-page-in-python/
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
pip install bs4

working but not downloading all images on all websites, only really worked on stocksnap.io(?)

//might try this next https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/download-web-page-images-python
//pip install tqdm

works the same but not what i need also slower. 

//try this next https://www.thepythoncode.com/code/download-web-page-images-python#download_images_js
//pip install requests_html 

can't figure out how to run so went back to first one. 
look into href="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/~~~" filter to download only src tags under those. 
also src="googlesyndication"

Apprently can't live read a website with an OCR. have to download ads for now (or take screenshots of the ads). Maybe look into making something like that in future. 

auto take screenshots of certain html sections of page https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-get-the-screenshot-of-a-particular-section-of-the-page-like-the-logo-of-a-website-in-selenium-with-python
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager

//div[@id="ad-container"]
//nav[@class="header_nav"]

WORKING I ACTUALLY GOT IT TO AUTO CROP AN AD.
Now try to get multiple ads cropping correctly. Not sure how at this point. Might ask Nbot.
got cropping working, had to ignore elements not on screen

pytesseract attempt at improving accuracy

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

pytesseract working much better now

Need to get list of companies from powrbot.com https://powrbot.com/companies/list-of-companies-in-united-states/
sent email about it, gonna wait for reply before i find another

Going to manually add companies to a csv files that the ads find. Will tell each cap to check the list for a company from the text. If it finds it then +1 on that list to that company, 
if not then save that string txt and move on. also need to make ads only +1 once per total screencap? (in case one page has 5 ads of same company?)

Can't get it to compare img strings to csv file of companies. imageText doesn't work and neither does opening a new file and reading it. Also file2 == '' broke when imageText == '' worked. 

pip install fuzzywuzzy

fuzzywuzzy doesn't work great. 
look into woosh for text searching (nvmd)

assigning into a dict each found ad is now working. the hard part is getting it to find the ads. need to work more on pytesseract for more accuracy, 
and use the following link to give each company more options for being found:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21744804/how-to-read-comma-separated-values-from-a-text-file-then-output-result-to-a-tex

pytesseract working as best I can after fudging with the settings. 
Got split() working on companyNames.txt so I can get 1 company name from multiple possibilities now. 
Still would like to get horizontal banner ads working better, maybe i can split the ad into parts so psm 4 (vertical block read) works better?
Also would like to only print to a txt file and save the image file if the ad was not found, for a better companynames.txt (i would only have to edit in the non found ones)

Either way...
SOFTWARE COMPLETE. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. 


pip uninstall fuzzywuzzy
pip uninstall html5lib
pip uninstall bs4

pip install matplotllib

got pie chart working correctly with absolute values. 
made the relevent screenshot save into the text folder along with the relevent text like before (for easier debugging). should have same name so i can compare them. 
Might have to re evaulate a better debugging process. maybe making a new folder for each pair (picture and text).

ran 100 queries on zerohedge.com (a known pro russian far right conspiracy site) using peerblock and protonvpn for safety. pie chart looks good. program working as intended. 

just need to redo the naming process of the files for better clarity on which picture they are linked to

Now its just a matter of getting these sites, and adding companies to the list

Added a feature for keeping a screenshot of the entire page whenever a new company is found, so I can test false positives as well as give proof if companies ask. 
Found first false postive with this feature already. An ad that it thought was an HP ad was actually some water bottle company with the text "H/PHC" or something. 
It seemed to ignore the / and thought it was an HP ad. Might need to look into this. 

Need to make feature that auto exports the dict to a saveable form after completeing a long query.
